# MyRecipeBook

This is a personal, digital collection of my favorite recipes, organized in a simple, easy-to-read format. It's built using HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and minimal JavaScript for navigation.

Features ----------
Clean Navigation: Easily switch between the Welcome page, Contents list, and individual recipes.

Mobile-Friendly Design: The layout adjusts automatically for optimal viewing on phones, tablets, and desktops.

Static & Reliable: The content is baked into the structure, meaning it's fast, secure, and requires no database or server to run.

How It Works ----------
This application is designed to be purely for viewing and reading.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure and content for every page (including the recipes themselves).

Tailwind CSS: Used for all modern, utility-first styling and responsive design.

JavaScript: Manages the simple page transitions (i.e., when you click a link, it shows the correct recipe section and hides the others).

Structure and Files -----------
The entire application runs on three files:

File Name &	Purpose
index.html->	The main file containing the app structure, all recipe content, and the Tailwind CSS link.
styles.css->	Contains custom CSS rules (currently minimal, mostly for page transition styles).
script.js->	Contains the simple showPage() function that handles all internal navigation.
